# Matplotlib_HW
Pyber Ride

Uses the Pandas Python library and Matplotlib to analyze a recordset of rides from a ride sharing app. This dataset contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

The objective of this assignment is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, analysis includes the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
